minnich and Vizcaino 1988 reported plot values from 3 surveys in SSPM by Allen in 1888. Values were a circumfrence with units in ft and inches with ft in one column and inches in another column

# calc basal area (unbinned)
```{r}
data_basal <- data %>% 
  mutate(dbh_in2 = diameter_in^2,
         basal_ft2 = 0.005454*dbh_in2, 
         basal_m2 = basal_ft2/10.764,
         basal_ha = basal_m2/0.4) %>% # plots = 1acre or 0.4-hectare
  group_by(plot) %>% 
  summarize(sum_basal = sum(basal_ha)) %>% 
  summarize(mean_sum_basal = mean(sum_basal))

```
